## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

- This project was about building some confidence with the CUBE CSS methodology. I can't really call it a success because i ended up with more questions and only a handful of answers along the way.

That being said, i feel more accustomed with some part of the methodology like the utility classes and the blocks. I have difficulties with the composition and exception parts mainly because i don't know exactly at what point am i supposed to work on them. I imagine most of my troubles come from my lack of experience. Building other projects will probably help me better understand how am i supposed to apply the cube and in what order.

- This was my first project on Frontend Mentor using JavaScript. Thankfully, it was mainly DOM manipulation which is great because it's basically the extent of my knowledge with the language. I don't think i learned a lot from this project but it definitely helped me remember quite a few things (i didn't use JS in a long time)!

### Continued development

- On this project, i was so focused on cube methodology and layout that i totally neglected HTML's semantic tags and ended up using a lot of divs. That's definitely something i'll be more careful of in the future.
- Also, i'm gonna keep using CUBE CSS (or at least i'll used what i understand of the cube... which is not much at the moment!) because even if i don't think that this is that powerful as a metholodogy, i still like the thought process behind it. And i think it's better to stick with a naming convention you like than to focus on a more popular one that you don't.

### Useful resources
